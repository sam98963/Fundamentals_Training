# Fundamentals_Training
The aim is to practice for one hour every day on fundamentals - using codewars and leetcode.

Each day I will add new .js files with the solutions for (new) katas and challenges I have solved. I will try to optimise them as much as I know how before submitting, but then I will leave them until a later date, checking against optimal/alternative solutions.
